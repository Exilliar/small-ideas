# Small Ideas

A collection of small ideas/projects that are not large enough to warrent their own repos, but still interesting enough to be saved.

## Basic structure

Each different language will contain it's own file, then each small idea will have it's own file there. Each small idea should have it's own README and should not be larger than one or two files

The rules on number of files are not set in stone, these ideas are mainly done for fun so the requirments are loose and flexible
