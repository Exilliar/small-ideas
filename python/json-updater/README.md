# Json Updater

A simple python script to mass update json file values to a new set value

## Qualifiers

This script was made for a single purpose and is very basic.

There is no error handling, if the supplied values are not in the json file, then it will likely fail.

It also assumes that the new values to set the fields to are integers, it may be updated later to include other types, but this is unlikely
